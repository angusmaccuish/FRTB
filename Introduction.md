# Minimum capital requirements for market risk

## Introduction

This document sets outs the amended minimum capital requirements for market risk that will serve as the Pillar 1 minimum
capital requirement as of 1 January 2022, replacing the current minimum capital requirements for market risk as set out
in Basel
II^[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework: Comprehensive Version, June 2006]
and its subsequent amendments.

This standard supersedes the January 2016 publication Minimum capital requirements for market
risk,^[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Minimum capital requirements for market risk, January 2016] for which the
Basel Committee proposed targeted revisions via a March 2018 consultative
document.^[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Consultative Document â€“ Revisions to the minimum capital requirements for market risk, March 2018]
Descriptions of the changes that have been incorporated into the standard relative to the January 2016 publication are
set out in the publication Explanatory note on the minimum capital requirements for market
risk.^[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Explanatory note on the minimum capital requirements for market risk, January 2019]

The market risk standard set out in this document has been prepared in a new modular format. This reflects the style of
a "consolidated framework" currently being prepared by the Basel Committee, which intends to improve the accessibility
of the Basel
standards.^[For the purpose of this publication, cross-references to other paragraphs or chapters are indicated within square brackets (eg \[MAR21.1\]). These will be replaced with hyperlinks once the consolidated framework is made available on the BCBS website.]
The Committee expects to publish all standards in this format on its website in the coming months. An alternate version
of the standard that includes previously published frequently asked questions is also available on the Basel Committee
website.^[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Minimum capital requirements for market risk, January 2019 (version includes frequently asked questions)]
