# MAR21 Standardised approach: sensitivities-based method

This chapter sets out the calculation of the sensitivities-based method under the standardised approach for market risk.

## Main concepts of the sensitivities-based method

The sensitivities of financial instruments to a prescribed list of risk factors are used to calculate the delta, vega
and curvature risk capital requirements. These sensitivities are risk-weighted and then aggregated, first within risk
buckets (risk factors with common characteristics) and then across buckets within the same risk class as set out
in [MAR21.8] to [MAR21.14]. The following terminology is used in the sensitivities-based method:

1. Risk class: seven risk classes are defined (in [MAR21.39] to [MAR21.89]).

    * General interest rate risk (GIRR)
    * Credit spread risk (CSR): non-securitisations
    * CSR: securitisations (non-correlation trading portfolio, or non-CTP)
    * CSR: securitisations (correlation trading portfolio, or CTP)
    * Equity risk
    * Commodity risk
    * Foreign exchange (FX) risk

2. Risk factor: variables (eg an equity price or a tenor of an interest rate curve) that affect the value of an
   instrument as defined in [MAR21.8] to [MAR21.14]

3. Bucket: a set of risk factors that are grouped together by common characteristics (eg all tenors of interest rate
   curves for the same currency), as defined in [MAR21.39] to [MAR21.89]

4. Risk position: the portion of the risk of an instrument that relates to a risk factor. Methodologies to calculate
   risk positions for delta, vega and curvature risks are set out in [MAR21.3] to [MAR21.5] and [MAR21.15] to
   [MAR21.26].

    * For delta and vega risks, the risk position is a sensitivity to a risk factor.
    * For curvature risk, the risk position is based on losses from two stress scenarios.

5. Risk capital requirement: the amount of capital that a bank should hold as a consequence of the risks it takes; it is
   computed as an aggregation of risk positions first at the bucket level, and then across buckets within a risk class
   defined for the sensitivities-based method as set out in [MAR21.3] to [MAR21.7].

## Instruments subject to each component of the sensitivities-based method

In applying the sensitivities-based method, all instruments held in trading desks as set out in [MAR12] and subject to
the sensitivities-based method (ie excluding instruments where the value at any point in time is purely driven by an
exotic underlying as set out in [MAR23.3]), are subject to delta risk capital requirements. Additionally, the
instruments specified in (1) to (4) are subject to vega and curvature risk capital requirements:

1. Any instrument with optionality
   ^[For example, each instrument that is an option or that includes an option (eg an embedded option such as convertibility or rate dependent prepayment and that is subject to the capital requirements for market risk). A non-exhaustive list of example instruments with optionality includes: calls, puts, caps, floors, swaptions, barrier options and exotic options.]

2. Any instrument with an embedded prepayment option
   ^[An instrument with a prepayment option is a debt instrument which grants the debtor the right to repay part of or the entire principal amount before the contractual maturity without having to compensate for any foregone interest. The debtor can exercise this option with a financial gain to obtain funding over the remaining maturity of the instrument at a lower rate in other ways in the market.]
   – this is considered an instrument with optionality according to above (1). The embedded option is subject to vega
   and curvature risk with respect to interest rate risk and CSR (
   non-securitisation and securitisation) risk classes. When the prepayment option is a behavioural option the
   instrument may also be subject to the residual risk add-on (RRAO) as per [MAR23]. The pricing model of the bank must
   reflect such behavioural patterns where relevant. For securitisation tranches, instruments in the securitised
   portfolio may have embedded prepayment options as well. In this case the securitisation tranche may be subject to the
   RRAO.

3. Instruments whose cash flows cannot be written as a linear function of underlying notional. For example, the cash
   flows generated by a plain-vanilla option cannot be written as a linear function (as they are the maximum of the spot
   and the strike). Therefore, all options are subject to vega risk and curvature risk. Instruments whose cash flows can
   be written as a linear function of underlying notional are instruments without optionality (eg cash flows generated
   by a coupon bearing bond can be written as a linear function) and are not subject to vega risk nor curvature risk
   capital requirements.

4. Curvature risks may be calculated for all instruments subject to delta risk, not limited to those subject to vega
   risk as specified in (1) to (3) above. For example, where a bank manages the non-linear risk of instruments with
   optionality and other instruments holistically, the bank may choose to include instruments without optionality in the
   calculation of curvature risk. This treatment is allowed subject to all of the following restrictions:

    * Use of this approach shall be applied consistently through time.
    * Curvature risk must be calculated for all instruments subject to the sensitivities-based method.

## Process to calculate the capital requirement under the sensitivities-based method

As set out in [MAR21.1], the capital requirement under the sensitivities-based method is calculated by aggregating
delta, vega and curvature capital requirements. The relevant paragraphs that describe this process are as follows:

1. The risk factors for delta, vega and curvature risks for each risk class are defined in [MAR21.8] to [MAR21.14].

2. The methods to risk weight sensitivities to risk factors and aggregate them to calculate delta and vega risk
   positions for each risk class are set out in [MAR21.4] and [MAR21.15] to [MAR21.95], which include the definition of
   delta and vega sensitivities, definition of buckets, risk weights to apply to risk factors, and correlation
   parameters.

3. The methods to calculate curvature risk are set out in [MAR21.5] and [MAR21.96] to [MAR21.101], which include the
   definition of buckets, risk weights and correlation parameters.

4. The risk class level capital requirement calculated above must be aggregated to obtain the capital requirement at the
   entire portfolio level as set out in [MAR21.6] and [MAR21.7].

## Calculation of the delta and vega risk capital requirement for each risk class

For each risk class, a bank must determine its instruments’ sensitivity to a set of prescribed risk factors, risk weight
those sensitivities, and aggregate the resulting risk-weighted sensitivities separately for delta and vega risk using
the following step-by-step approach:

1. For each risk factor (as defined in [MAR21.8] to [MAR21.14]), a sensitivity is determined as set out in [MAR21.15]
   to [MAR21.38].

2. Sensitivities to the same risk factor must be netted to give a net sensitivity $s_k$ across all instruments in the
   portfolio to each risk factor k. In calculating the net sensitivity, all sensitivities to the same given risk
   factor (eg all sensitivities to the one-year tenor point of the three-month Euribor swap curve) from instruments of
   opposite direction should offset, irrespective of the instrument from which they derive. For instance, if a bank’s
   portfolio is made of two interest rate swaps on three-month Euribor with the same fixed rate and same notional but of
   opposite direction, the GIRR on that portfolio would be zero.

3. The weighted sensitivity $WS_K$ is the product of the net sensitivity $s_k$ and the corresponding risk weight
   $\mathit{RW}_k$ as defined in [MAR21.39] to [MAR21.95]. $$ \mathit{WS}_k = \mathit{RW}_k \times s_k $$

4. Within bucket aggregation: the risk position for delta (respectively vega) bucket b, $K_b$ must be determined by
   aggregating the weighted sensitivities to risk factors within the same bucket using the prescribed correlation $\rho_
   {kl}$ set out in the following formula, where the quantity within the square root function is floored at zero:
   $$ K_b = \sqrt{ \max \left(0, \sum_k{\mathit{WS}_k^2} + \sum_k \sum_{k \ne l} {\rho_{kl} \mathit{WS}_k \mathit{WS}_l} \right)} $$

5. Across bucket aggregation: The delta (respectively vega) risk capital requirement is calculated by aggregating the
   risk positions across the delta (respectively vega) buckets within each risk class, using the corresponding
   prescribed correlations $\gamma_{bc}$ as set out in the following formula, where:

    * $S_b = \sum_k{ \mathit{WS}_k }$ for all risk factors in bucket b, and $S_c = \sum_k{ \mathit{WS}_k }$ in bucket c.
    * If these values for $S_b$ and $S_c$ described in above [MAR21.4](5)(a) produce a negative number for the overall
      sum of $\sum{K_b^2} + \sum_b \sum_{c \ne b} {\gamma_{bc} S_b S_c}$, the bank is to calculate the delta (
      respectively vega) risk capital requirement using an alternative specification whereby

        * $S_b = \max \left[ \min \left( \sum_k{\mathit{WS}_k, K_b} \right), -K_b \right]$ for all risk factors in
          bucket b; and

        * $S_c = \max \left[ \min \left( \sum_k{\mathit{WS}_k, K_c} \right), -K_c \right]$ for all risk factors in
          bucket c.

   $$ Delta (respectively, vega) = \sqrt{ \max \left(0, \sum_k{ K_b^2 } + \sum_b \sum_{c \ne b} { \gamma_{bc} S_b S_c } \right)} $$
   
## Calculation of the curvature risk capital requirement for each risk class

For each risk class, to calculate curvature risk capital requirements a bank must apply an upward shock and a downward
shock to each prescribed risk factor and calculate the incremental loss for instruments sensitive to that risk factor
above that already captured by the delta risk capital requirement using the following step-by-step approach:

1. For each instrument sensitive to curvature risk factor k, an upward shock and a downward shock must be applied to k.
   The size of shock (ie risk weight) is set out in [MAR21.98] and [MAR21.99].

   * For example for GIRR, all tenors of all the risk free interest rate curves within a given currency (eg three-month
     Euribor, six-month Euribor, one year Euribor, etc for the euro) must be shifted upward applying the risk weight as
     set out in [MAR21.99]. The resulting potential loss for each instrument, after the deduction of the delta risk
     positions, is the outcome of the upward scenario. The same approach must be followed on a downward scenario.

   * If the price of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the curvature risk must be determined separately for
     each risk factor.

2. The net curvature risk capital requirement, determined by the values $\mathit{CVR}_k^+$ and $\mathit{CVR}_k^-$ for a
   bank's portfolio for risk factor k described in above [MAR21.5](1) is calculated by the formula below. It calculates
   the aggregate incremental loss beyond the delta capital requirement for the prescribed shocks, where

   * i is an instrument subject to curvature risks associated with risk factor k;

   * $x_k$ is the current level of risk factor k;

   * $V_i(x_k)$ is the price of instrument i at the current level of risk factor k;

   * $V_i(x_k^{\mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})+}})$ and $V_i(x_k^{\mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})-}})$ denote the
     price of instrument i after $x_k$ is shifted (ie "shocked") upward and downward respectively;

   * $\mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})}$ is the risk weight for curvature risk factor k for instrument i; and

   * $s_{ik}$ is the delta sensitivity of instrument i with respect to the delta risk factor that corresponds to
     curvature risk factor k, where:

      * for the FX and equity risk classes $s_{ik}$ is the delta sensitivity of instrument i; and

      * for the GIRR, CSR and commodity risk classes, $s_{ik}$ is the sum of delta sensitivities to all tenors of the
        relevant curve of instrument i with respect to curvature risk factor k.
        
     $$
     \begin{aligned}[t]
         \mathit{CVR}_k^+ &= -\sum { \left( V_i(x_k^{\mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})+}}) - V_i(x_k) - \mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})} \times s_{ik} \right)}\\
         \mathit{CVR}_k^- &= -\sum { \left( V_i(x_k^{\mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})-}}) - V_i(x_k) + \mathit{RW}^{(\mathit{curvature})} \times s_{ik} \right)}
     \end{aligned}
     $$

3. Within bucket aggregation: the curvature risk exposure must be aggregated within each bucket using the corresponding
   prescribed correlation $\rho_{kl}$ as set out in the following formula, where:

   * The bucket level capital requirement ($K_b$) is determined as the greater of the capital requirement under the
     upward scenario ($K_b^+$) and the capital requirement under the downward scenario ($K_b^-$). Notably, the selection
     of upward and downward scenarios is not necessarily the same across the high, medium and low correlations scenarios
     specified in [MAR21.6].

      * Where $K_b = K_b^+$, this shall be termed "selecting the upward scenario".

      * Where $K_b = K_b^-$, this shall be termed "selecting the downward scenario".

      * In the specific case where $K_b^+ = K_b^-$, if $\sum_k {\mathit{CVR}_k^+} > \sum_k {\mathit{CVR}_k^-}$, it is
        deemed that the upward scenario is selected; otherwise the downward scenario is selected.

   * $\psi(\mathit{CVR}_k, \mathit{CVR}_l)$ takes the value 0 if $\mathit{CVR}_k$ and $\mathit{CVR}_l$ both have
     negative signs and the value 1 otherwise.
     
     $$ K_b = \max(K_b^+, K_b^-) $$
   
     where
   
     $$
     \begin{aligned}[t]
         K_b^+ &= ...\\
         K_b^- &= ...
     \end{aligned}
     $$
