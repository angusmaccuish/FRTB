# MAR23 Standardised approach: residual risk add-on

This chapter sets out the calculation of residual risk add-on under the standardised approach for market risk.

## Introduction

The residual risk add-on (RRAO) is to be calculated for all instruments bearing residual risk separately in addition to
other components of the capital requirement under the standardised approach.

## Instruments subject to the residual risk add-on

Instruments with an exotic underlying and instruments bearing other residual risks are subject to the RRAO.

Instruments with an exotic underlying are trading book instruments with an underlying exposure that is not within the
scope of delta, vega or curvature risk treatment in any risk class under the sensitivities-based method or default risk
capital (DRC) requirements in the standardised
approach.^[Examples of exotic underlying exposures include: longevity risk, weather, natural disasters, future realised volatility (as an underlying exposure for a swap).]

Instruments bearing other residual risks are those that meet criteria (1) and (2) below:

1. Instruments subject to vega or curvature risk capital requirements in the trading book and with pay-offs that cannot
   be written or perfectly replicated as a finite linear combination of vanilla options with a single underlying equity
   price, commodity price, exchange rate, bond price, credit default swap price or interest rate swap; or

2. Instruments which fall under the definition of the correlation trading portfolio (CTP) in [MAR20.5], except for those
   instruments that are

A non-exhaustive list of other residual risks types and instruments that may fall within the criteria set out
in [MAR23.4] include:

1. Gap risk: risk of a significant change in vega parameters in options due to small movements in the underlying, which
   results in hedge slippage. Relevant instruments subject to gap risk include all path dependent options, such as
   barrier options, and Asian options as well as all digital options.

2. Correlation risk: risk of a change in a correlation parameter necessary for determining the value of an instrument
   with multiple underlyings. Relevant instruments subject to correlation risk include all basket options,
   best-of-options, spread options, basis options, Bermudan options and quanto options.

3. Behavioural risk: risk of a change in exercise/prepayment outcomes such as those that arise in fixed rate mortgage
   products where retail clients may make decisions motivated by factors other than pure financial gain (such as
   demographical features and/or and other social factors). A callable bond may only be seen as possibly having
   behavioural risk if the right to call lies with a retail client.

When an instrument is subject to one or more of the following risk types, this by itself will not cause the instrument
to be subject to the RRAO:

1. Risk from a cheapest-to-deliver option;

2. Smile risk: the risk of a change in an implied volatility parameter necessary for determining the value of an
   instrument with optionality relative to the implied volatility of other instruments optionality with the same
   underlying and maturity, but different moneyness;

3. Correlation risk arising from multi-underlying European or American plain vanilla options, and from any options that
   can be written as a linear combination of such options. This exemption applies in particular to the relevant index
   options;

4. Dividend risk arising from a derivative instrument whose underlying does not consist solely of dividend payments; and

5. Index instruments and multi-underlying options of which treatment for delta, vega or curvature risk are set out
   in [MAR21.31] and [MAR21.32]. These are subject to the RRAO if they fall within the definitions set out in this
   chapter. For funds that are subject to the treatment specified in [MAR21.36](3) (ie treated as an unrated “other
   sector” equity), banks shall assume the fund is exposed to exotic underlying exposures, and to other residual risks,
   to the maximum possible extent allowed under the fund’s mandate.

In cases where a transaction exactly matches with a third-party transaction (ie a back-to-back transaction), the
instruments used in both transactions must be excluded from the RRAO capital requirement. Any instrument that is listed
and/or eligible for central clearing must be excluded from the RRAO.

## Calculation of the residual risk add-on

The residual risk add-on must be calculated in addition to any other capital requirements within the standardised
approach. The residual risk add-on is to be calculated as follows.

1. The scope of instruments that are subject to the RRAO must not have an impact in terms of increasing or decreasing
   the scope of risk factors subject to the delta, vega, curvature or DRC treatments in the standardised approach.

2. The RRAO is the simple sum of gross notional amounts of the instruments bearing residual risks, multiplied by a risk
   weight.

    * The risk weight for instruments with an exotic underlying specified in [MAR23.3] is 1.0\%.
    * The risk weight for instruments bearing other residual risks specified in [MAR23.4] is
      0.1\%.^[Where the bank cannot satisfy the supervisor that the RRAO provides a sufficiently prudent capital charge, the supervisor will address any potentially under-capitalised risks by imposing a conservative additional capital charge under Pillar 2.]
